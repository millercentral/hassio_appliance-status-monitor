  ## **OPTIONAL**
  ## NAME: State translation macro
  ## INSTRUCTIONS: https://github.com/leofabri/hassio_appliance-status-monitor/issues/16#issuecomment-1211764562
  ## DSCRIPTION: This macro translates each state into something more human-readable.
  ##             A sensor is created and available to the user.
  ##             The following lines define how each state should be translated:
  ##                <state>: <translation to whatever I like>
  ##
  ##             It allows you to customize how each state should be displayed on the UI.

  ## The template below is disabled by default, 
  ## if you want to enable it you need to uncomment the lines that will follow (remove all the '# ').
  ## Press ctrl + K & ctrl + U to uncomment from VSCode.
